First need to answer these questions:
    - Does the application have a large workload?
        - Yes: 
            Use ECS with EC2 model to run your containers
            Elastic Beanstalk
            Spin up EC2
        
        - No:
            ECS with Fargate (Serverless) model
            Elastic Beanstalk
            Spin up EC2

Deployment:
- ECS:
    - Can use ECS to manage containers on a cluster if you want to have multiple hosts which each have a different task
        - i.e. one host to host the website and another host to poll all the data input and store it in a database
            - This lets you run and maintain the tasks simultaenously etc
        - Might be too advanced for this app as its simple but bonus points for using this

- Elastic Beanstalk
    - Can use Elastic Beanstalk to deploy the application but needs to be in a supported language (Java, .NET, PHP, Node js, Python, Docker, can Google what other languages are supported)

- EC2 standalone
    - Or can simply spin up some EC2 instances and run the source code as a Docker container or build it via CI/CD tools

Scalability:
-
