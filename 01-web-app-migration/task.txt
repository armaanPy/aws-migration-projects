A customer requires an application to be deployed to AWS that captures data input via a website and stores the output in a database.

How it is deployed is up to you and can be done using EC2, serverless/containers or something else. The customer has asked for the following as bonus points, so meeting some or all of these is a plus:
	• The application should be scalable and withstand an increase in load
	• The application should be fault tolerant and survive availability zone failure
	• Centralised logging of application and infrastructure metrics
	• Secure configuration at the network level
	• Automatically deploys when a new version is created
