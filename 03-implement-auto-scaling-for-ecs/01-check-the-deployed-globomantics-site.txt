***Check the deployed Globomantics site***

- Globomantics has asked you to help scale their website. They have recently containerized their application, and your job is to set up the applicationâ€™s scaling rules.

- From the AWS Management Console, complete the following steps:

1. From the Services list, select EC2.
2. From the navigation menu on the left, select Load Balancers. You should see an Application Load Balancer called Globo-Prod-Alb. 
This is the load balancer Globomantics is using to forward traffic to the application. If there is no load balancer on the screen, you may need to wait a few more minutes. 
3. Select Globo-Prod-Alb.
4. You should see a description of the load balancer appear on the bottom of the screen. Copy the DNS Name. Open a new browser tab and paste the DNS Name into the browser bar. You should see the following page appear on your screen.
