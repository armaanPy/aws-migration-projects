16. Set Add task in increments of at least 1 task(s).
17. Set Cooldown period to 60 seconds between scaling actions. This will create a scaling rule that will have ECS add 10% more tasks as requests go up. If the requests go beyond even a higher threshold, it will add 10% more for a total of 20%. The policy should look like the following:
18. Click Save.
19. Create another scaling policy by repeating steps 10-18 with the following changes: 
Name the policy Task-Scale-Down

    Set the policy to Remove 10 percent when 10000 >= RequestCount >  5000 and Remove 20 percent when 5000 >= RequestCount -infinity. 
    Set Remove tasks in increments of at least to 1
This will create a scaling rule that will have ECS remove 20% of tasks as requests go down. If the requests go beyond even an even lower threshold, it will remove 10% more for a total of 20%.
20. Click Next step.
21. Click Update Service.
