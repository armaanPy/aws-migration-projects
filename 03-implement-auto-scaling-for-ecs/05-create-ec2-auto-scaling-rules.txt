From the AWS Management Console, complete the following steps:

1. In the top search box, type in and click on EC2.
2. From the EC2 navigation menu on the left, select Auto Scaling Groups.
3. Select the Globo-Prod-Asg group.
4. On the menu on the lower part of the screen, click the Automatic scaling tab.
5. Under Dynamic scaling policies, click Create dynamic scaling policy.
6. Set Policy type to Step scaling.
7. Set Scaling policy name to EC2-Scale-Up.
8. Set CloudWatch alarm to Globo-ECS-MemoryReservation-Up.
9. Click Add step.
10. Under Take the action: configure it to Add 10 Percent of group when 60 <= MemoryReservation < 80 and 20 Percent of group when 80 <= MemoryReservation <+infinity.
11. Set Add capacity units in increments of at least 1 capacity units.
12. Set Instances need to 60 seconds warm up before including in metric.
13. Click Create.
14. Create a new policy by repeating steps 5-13 with the following changes: 
    Name the policy EC2-Scale-Down.
    Use the Globo-ECS-MemoryReservation-Down alarm.
    Under Take the action configure it to Remove 10 Percent of group when 40 >= MemoryReservation > 20 and 20 Percent of group when 20 >= MemoryReservation > -infinity.
You should now have two scaling policies associated with the Auto Scaling Group: one for scaling out, and another for scaling in.
